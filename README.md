# Ora - Retro Flip Clock ‚è∞

A minimalist, full-screen flip clock application for Android, designed with a retro aesthetic and an AMOLED-friendly interface. This project was built to explore core Android development concepts, including custom UI, a full settings menu with `PreferenceScreen`, and modern Android APIs like the Photo Picker.
