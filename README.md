## ‚ú® A Class Apart: Features & Benefits

Ora.AI isn't just another clock app; it's a complete style engine for your screen. We provide a level of control and personalization that you won't find anywhere else.

### üé® Unmatched Customization
This is the core of Ora.AI. We believe you should have total control over every pixel.

* **Dynamic Positioning:** Unlike other clock apps that are fixed in place, Ora.AI lets you move the **Clock and Date independently**. Use simple sliders to position them exactly where you want, both vertically and horizontally.
* **Total Text Control:** Customize the **font, size, color, and highlight style** (Shadow or Outline) for every single text element‚Äîthe main clock, the date, and the AM/PM indicator.
* **Your Photos as a Backdrop:** Go beyond our built-in wallpapers. Select **any image from your device's gallery** to use as a personal, high-resolution background.
* **Digit Background Styling:** Fine-tune the look of the digit containers with **Filled, Outline, or Transparent** styles, complete with color and opacity controls.

### üí° Smart & Effortless Styling
For moments when you need inspiration, Ora.AI offers powerful tools to discover new looks without the effort.

* **Style Presets:** Found a look you love? **Save up to 5 complete styles** as presets. Load them back instantly from a simple dropdown menu, letting you switch moods in a single tap.
* **Instant Discovery:** Feeling adventurous? The **"Randomize Style"** button instantly generates a new, unique theme, discovering combinations you might not have thought of.
* **Automated Color Cycling:** Enable **"Auto-change Text Colors"** for a dynamic, ever-changing display that cycles through the color palette at an interval you set.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Powerful Utility Features
Beyond looks, Ora.AI is packed with useful features designed for a seamless experience.

* **Built-in Screenshot Tool:** Capture your perfect design. A dedicated button in the settings saves a high-quality screenshot of your clock screen directly to your photo gallery.
* **OLED Optimized & Battery Conscious:** The default **Amoled Black** theme is perfect for OLED screens, turning off pixels to save power and provide stunning contrast. The screen also **auto-dims** after a period of inactivity to conserve battery life.
* **Immersive, Distraction-Free UI:** Ora.AI provides a true full-screen experience. The settings button **automatically hides** after a customizable delay, leaving you with a clean and elegant display.
